# Initial plan: parameterized BixBench task 4

Objective: Using an ordinal logistic regression model (ordered logit), what is the odds ratio associated with healthcare workers' expected patient interaction (expect_interact_cat) on the likelihood of reporting higher COVID-19 severity (AESEV), after adjusting for number of patients seen (patients_seen_cat) and BCG vaccination status (TRTGRP_cat)?

Before Galaxy query_tabular execution, evaluate available query parameters: table name, header handling, SQL expression, output header prefix. Select table_name=answers, column_names_from_first_line=true, SQL selecting the precomputed task answer where selected=1, and header_prefix=#.

Scientific/preprocessing parameter choice: BCG parameter selection: use all adverse-event records with AESEV present; ordinal logit covariates TRTGRP_cat, expect_interact_cat, patients_seen_cat; chi-square strata as prompted.
